    <h2 id="which-actors-can-counteract" style="display:inline">Which actors can counteract the climate crisis?</h2>

    <p><span class="c2">Currently, the fight against climate change is entrusted to three types of
            actors:</span></p>
    <ol class="c7 lst-kix_list_1-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c5 li-bullet-1">States and the international organisations they create. This field of action
                is, so to speak, &ldquo;natural&rdquo;: the phenomenon has such dimensions and complexity that it
                requires joint collective actions at a supranational level.</li>
        <li class="c5 li-bullet-1">Organisations formed by<span
                class="c14">&nbsp;private individuals </span><span class="c2">dedicated to this purpose, usually
                NGOs.</span></li>
        <li class="c10 li-bullet-2">The people <span class="c2">in a broad sense, the
                inhabitants of the world:</span>&nbsp;earthlings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The problem of climate change should be analysed using risk assessment methodologies
        regarding the ability of the above actors to introduce measures for prevention and containment of climate
        change, their potential effectiveness and the relative probability of success. In fact, each of the actors
        listed above has characteristics that can potentially undermine the effectiveness of their actions.
    </p>

    <h3 id="limits-of-states" style="display:inline">The limits of States</h3>

    <p>States (and those who represent them) are forced&mdash;in most cases&mdash;to obey a logic based
            on wealth production/resource consumption, to ensure their own development but often also their very
            survival. The underlying problem is the correlation between economic growth and consumption of natural
            resources. A certain narrative of the so-called &ldquo;green economy&rdquo; has tried to overcome the
            problem through an alleged decoupling between economic growth and environmental impact, but without
            success<sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup>, especially
            regarding energy consumption, which is closely linked to GDP and social development. </p>
    {{< cloudinary_img src="assets/post-img/image1_rudabi" class="capped-width-50"
        caption="Correlation of energy consumption and GDP per person; the graph shows per capita energy consumption (in tonnes of oil equivalent) versus per capita GDP (in thousand $2010). All values refer to the year 2015 (IEA, 2017)." >}}
    <p>This need is incompatible and antithetical to the objectives of fighting climate
            change. One of the components that strongly pushes States in this direction is the presence of high public
            debt, whose servicing cannot be performed without economic growth, under penalty of default (i.e. the death
            of the State). It is thus not reasonable to expect States (as any other biological or non-biological
            organism) to act in a way that may favour their own demise.</p>
    <p>There are clear signs confirming this difficulty: in 30 years of annual Conferences
            of Parties (intergovernmental meetings aimed at reducing GHG emissions into the atmosphere), a reduction in
            emissions was only recorded in 2009 (caused by the global economic crisis following the subprime/Lehman
            Brothers cases) and in 2020 (caused by the Covid19 pandemic).</p>
    <p>The increasingly conflictual course of international politics, the tendency to
            prioritise traditional economic reasons over those of fighting climate change, and lately the disengagement
            of some major States (e.g. USA, EU) in this regard and generally towards supranational collaborative
            systems, further reduce the probability that these actors can exercise effective action in this
            field.</p>
    <p>It should also be mentioned that climate change containment measures have rather long
            return times (on the order of decades) and are therefore mostly outside the time perspective of state
            representatives, normally limited to the duration of a mandate of 4 or 5 years (at least in state
            organisations with an electoral system), and thus cannot constitute an objective of interest for political
            figures whose priority is the electoral success (their own or their party&rsquo;s) in the next
            elections.</p>
    <p>Finally, political representatives are particularly subject to pressure from lobbies
            (economic and productive) whose interests are often antithetical to containing the climate crisis.
    </p>

    <h3 id="limits-of-ngos" style="display:inline">The limits of Non-Governmental Organisations</h3>

    <p>NGO activity is generally extremely fragmented, lacking coordination and systemic
            vision. NGOs are focused on specific aspects and areas of intervention, which makes their actions scattered,
            as well as often limited by available resources. Moreover, the quest for resources (human and financial)
            often generates competition among NGOs, which further limits the possibilities for collaboration between
            them.</p>
    <p>In fact, their action (even those of the largest ones, such as Greenpeace, WWF, etc.)
            never seems to go beyond the periodic and iterative denunciation of the deterioration of specific
            environmental aspects, without this resulting in a change in the logic of the socio-political and economic
            system sufficient to alter the course of events.</p>
    <p>Finally, their ability to influence the system is not only jeopardized by the amount
            of resources they can gather (human, financial) but also dependent on their ability to be represented in
            mainstream media, all this making their activities subordinate to the expectations of their &ldquo;major
            contributors&rdquo; and/or to the needs of mainstream media.</p>

    <h3 id="limits-of-people" style="display:inline">The limits of people</h3>

    <p>People are hindered in their action by countless factors, generally attributable to
            three categories of reasons, relating to cognitive biases, to the specificities of the problem and to the
            human nature:</p>
    <ul class="c7 lst-kix_list_8-0 start">
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-2">Many people are unaware of the causes <span>of
                climate</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;change and/or the scenarios that may result from it or, if they are
                not, do not think they are (often rightly so) among those who must take responsibility for the
                solution.</span></li>
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-2"><span class="c2">Many people do not consider climate change relevant and find
                confirmation of their opinion on social media (due to operating algorithms) and also as a consequence of
                the high propensity for polarisation of topics (confirmation bias).</span></li>
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Information on the topic is neither accurate nor sufficient, and
                users often find it difficult to distinguish true information from misinformation.</span></li>
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">The idea (more or less conscious) that governments and companies are
                better positioned to address the problem than individuals prevails, also in relation to the perceived
                complexity of the topic.</span></li>
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">There is a total lack of quantitative information: people largely
                know (at least partially) what is better and what is worse for the environment, but lacking quantitative
                knowledge and thus without being able to assess the impact of their behaviours, they substantially act
                without awareness.</span></li>
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Many people think they do enough for the environment in their daily
                lives. However, in the absence of quantitative information on the impact of their actions, this
                assumption risks being unfounded.</span></li>
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Many people think that their actions, however targeted and
                effective, cannot have any real effect on the problem, considering the impact of other individuals
                (especially understandable in countries with relatively low resources consumption levels).</span></li>
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Many people consider other problems (especially those related to the
                economy, conflicts, etc.) to be more important and that the environmental problem should be subordinated
                to them.</span></li>
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Specific human cognitive and psychological mechanisms - the result
                of an evolution that has allowed humans to establish themselves over hundreds of thousands of years as
                the dominant species on the planet - can prove unsuitable and detrimental in addressing the climate
                crisis. In particular:</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ol class="c7 lst-kix_list_9-0 start" start="1">
        <li class="c5 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">The temporally deferred dimension of the problem, whereby the
                effects of actions taken today become perceptible in a few decades (especially when actions intended to
                prevent a harm, that do not result in any evident effect). This aspect reduces interest and willingness
                to act.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">The spatially deferred dimension of the problem: those who do not
                feel directly affected by climate change today do not feel the need to act, even if they are aware of
                effects occurring elsewhere.</span></li>
        <li class="c10 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">The size and complexity of the problem - which appears to the
                individual as complex and immeasurable - generates anxiety (eco-anxiety) and seems impossible to
                tackle.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="which-actors-effectively" style="display:inline">Which actors can effectively counter the climate crisis?</h2>

    <p>In relation to the above, we have reached the following conclusions:</p>
    <ul class="c7 lst-kix_list_10-0 start">
        <li class="c19 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">It is vain (if not counterproductive) to thoroughly delegate the
                solution of the problem to States, the Organisations they have created, and NGOs, for the reasons
                outlined above.</span></li>
        <li class="c15 li-bullet-2"><span class="c2">People remain - in particular those with the highest per capita
                consumption and &nbsp;to the extent that they want and are enabled to act - the actor that can act for
                the containment of the climate crisis. However people must overcome a series of difficulties related to
                the specificity of human nature, to inadequate cultural and value models and to the cognitive biases of
                which they are victims.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="how-to-increase-probability" style="display:inline">How to increase the probability that people can effectively counteract the climate crisis?</h2>

    <p>To overcome the difficulties mentioned above, it would be necessary to intervene
            simultaneously in a pervasive and massive way on the educational, cognitive and cultural levels, through a
            multiplicity of actions and levels of intervention.</p>
    <p>Given the size and complexity of such intervention, as an Association we have decided
            to intervene on a specific cognitive aspect: trying to provide people with quantitative information
            regarding the environmental impact of their consumption and behaviour choices, adopting the energy
            consumption produced by their choices as a guiding parameter of environmental impact. The objective of this
            intervention is to create a shared knowledge system.</p>
    <p>Such a knowledge system, based on quantitative assessments, is currently completely
            non-existent. The main parameter for quantitative assessment of environmental impact, carbon dioxide
            equivalent (CO2e) is known to all but at the same time substantially unknown: how many people are able to
            understand what a kg of CO2e means and what it corresponds to in their daily habits and consumption
            behaviours?</p>
    <p>A 4-year-old child would have no objections to statements like &ldquo;it
            took me an hour to walk from Paris to Rome&rdquo; or &ldquo;I spent
            1,200 euros for a kilo of apples at the market&rdquo;, but you who are reading have
            immediate evidence of their inconsistency and absurdity, because you share a widespread knowledge about the
            quantitative aspects related to time, space, weight, currency, etc. connected to our life: this knowledge
            allows us an immediate and directionally correct assessment of the situations we face daily, and our choices
            are anchored to it.</p>
    <p>How many, instead, would consider to be absurd the statement &ldquo;This
            t-shirt has an ecological footprint of 100 g of CO2 equivalent&rdquo;? Very few.
            Yet, the order of magnitude of the error is the same as the previous statements: 100 x (the footprint of a
            t-shirt is around 10 kg)!</p>
    <p>Lord Kelvin said: &ldquo;If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve
            it&rdquo;. </p>
    <p>If we truly want to promote a culture of sustainability of individual action at a
            collective level &mdash; substantial and not wishful &mdash; it is necessary that people are enabled to
            measure daily the level of environmental compatibility of their behaviour, purchasing and lifestyle
            choices.</p>
    <p>We are aware of how ambitious this goal is and how limited our chances of achieving
            it are, but we are guided by the optimism of will and trust in the profound meaning of the proposed action.
            We believe this is the right path to quickly and effectively counter the climate crisis and that it can be
            undertaken with a relatively modest effort.</p>
    <p>The creation of a shared cognitive infrastructure on the quantitative aspects of the
            environmental impact of individual actions and behaviours is in fact a prerequisite for acting collectively
            towards a real and effective contrast to the environmental crisis.</p>
    <p>We intend to promote the creation and dissemination of:</p>
    <ul class="c7 lst-kix_list_3-0 start">
        <li class="c5 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Reliable information because it is based on validated and
                consolidated (albeit indicative) systems of environmental impact analysis (Embodied energy, Cumulated
                Energy Density, LCA analysis)</span></li>
        <li class="c5 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Shared quantitative information, definition of clear and unambiguous
                individual impact objectives, and cognitive tools useful to achieve them by modulating daily behaviour
                and purchasing choices to ultimately reduce one&rsquo;s energy footprint.</span></li>
        <li class="c5 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Individual awareness of the measure of one&rsquo;s environmental
                impact, its possible reduction, and possible ways to achieve it;</span></li>
        <li class="c10 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Reduction of the perceived complexity of the topic, reduction of

    <p>&ldquo;Conscious repayment of environmental debt&rdquo; is, in fact, the concept at
            the basis of the Association (and its name) and reflects the desire to ensure that every earthling can act
            consciously within the framework of a shared action to restore environmental balance. To achieve this goal,
            the Association has, in recent years:</p>

    <h2 id="suasi" style="display:inline">Suas&igrave;</h2>

    <p>Every product/service has an environmental cost, as it uses natural resources for its
            production and delivery; among these, one is always present: energy.</p>
    <p>Energy quantification can be used as a guiding parameter for conscious consumption,
            inducing the consumer to choose products with lower energy content (especially the fossil fuel based one) so
            as not to exceed its &ldquo;energy budget&rdquo;, just as the sale price of a good is the main parameter for
            a consumer who does not want (or cannot) exceed its economic budget.</p>
    <p>The <a class="c16"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iris.polito.it/handle/11583/3002327&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1768516277559437&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BYzwmET1xSG7WAxfiJmlw">EMCoin
                project</a>&nbsp;(EMbodied energy as a Coin) consists
            in creating a system for accounting the Emergy (Embodied
            energy) of products aimed at making the consumer aware of the environmental impact of its purchasing choices
            and able to decide how and to what extent to pursue its sustainability objectives.</p>
    <p>The project, launched in 2022, was made possible by contributions from the Waldensian
            Church, research funds from DISEG Polytechnic of Turin (Prof. C. Mele) and from the European Union, with the
            collaboration of various public and private entities.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the work of researchers and other involved parties, a methodological framework of
            average individual energy consumption applied to food, beverages, and detergents has been created, whose
        emergy values have been collected through specially developed
            databases (Ecoinvent, Agribalyse) and product EPDs. The system has been incorporated into an App:
            Suas&igrave;, currently the only one (as far as we know) aiming to provide a comprehensive and reliable
            guide towards environmentally sustainable choices by consumers and to nudge manufacturers to lower the
            fossil fuel energy embodied in their products.</p>
    <p>Each of us, through daily purchasing choices, can contribute to the fight against
            climate change, provided we know how these actions can affect the reduction of environmental impact.
    </p>
    <p>Suas&igrave; is the first App that allows you to know this data and aims to provide a
            tool through which individuals and families can assess, at the time of purchasing goods, how and to what
            extent they contribute to reducing their environmental impact, based on reliable data and by setting precise
            and measurable objectives.</p>
    <p>SuaS&igrave; comes from the ancient Gothic &ldquo;kausjan&rdquo;, which meant &ldquo;to examine, test, understand&rdquo;.</p>
